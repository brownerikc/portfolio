# Erik Brown's Portfolio
I'm Erik Brown, a professional technical writer with 15 years of experience. This repository contains a sample of my work.

## Developer-Focused Documentation
Documentation to introduce developers to new tools and concepts. I wrote these to help get developers started as fast as possible, focusing on features and capabilities over language-specific considerations.
* [Monetate SDK Documentation](https://developer.monetate.com/sdks)
* [Monetate Personalized Search](https://developer.monetate.com/personalized-search)

## Programming References
Complete function and method references for multiple programming languages. I maintained and updated these, adding new functions with every new version.
* [DAQmx VI Reference](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-daqmx-labview-api-ref/page/lvdaqmx/palmain.html)
* [DAQmx C Reference](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-daqmx-c-api-ref/page/cdaqmx/help_file_title.html)

These references were also installed with the software in CHM format for offline viewing. Dropbox links for copies:

## User Documentation
Not all users are developers. These are a few topics I've written introducing new concepts and how to use them.
* [Category Merchandising](https://docs.monetate.com/docs/category-merchandising)
* [Behavioral Triggers](https://docs.monetate.com/docs/create-a-behavioral-triggers-extract)

## Printed Manuals
Hardware manuals come with a different set of considerations such as specifications and safety information. Dropbox link for copies:
* [PXIe-1086DC User Manual and Specifications](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/iztahslx95efe4arpt9o7/PXIe-1086DC-UM.pdf?rlkey=qkcjdtigilgxgf2fwe9zjal9k&st=zlsezk7c&dl=0)

## Programming Projects
I also enjoy writing code from time to time, especially when I can make something to help efficiency. This repository contains the code of one such project:
* [Checklist Generator](https://github.com/brownerikc/checklist-generator)
